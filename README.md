# CleverCubs 🧠🐾 – Capstone iOS App

**CleverCubs** is an educational iOS app built for young learners (ages 2–6), designed to teach letters, colors, memory, and cognitive skills through fun mini-games and interactive tracing activities. Developed as part of my final Capstone Project at **triOS College – Mobile Web Developer Program**.
